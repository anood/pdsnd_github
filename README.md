### Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project for Introduction to Python

### Overview
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python I will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

- Python 3, Numpy and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
## The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate (https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: <b>Chicago</b>, <b>New York City</b>, and <b>Washington</b>.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

- Start Time 
- End Time 
- Trip Duration 
- Start Station 
- End Station 
- User Type 

The <b>Chicago</b> and <b>New York City</b> files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year
